### Welcome
*Euan Adie, Founder*

What we’ve learned from trying to measure impact

+ You probably can’t measure impact
+ Alt metrics = a bad name; not alternative and not really ‘measuring’ or judging quantitatively

Easy for people to conflate different aspects:

+ Quality
+ Attention
+ Impact

+ Engaging with a specific audience --> attention leads to impact
+ AltMetric can help with these.  Quality is another realm of expterise.

### Metrics in Research Evaluation
*Jane Tinkler, Senior Advisor, Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology*
@janetinkler

Discussing large-scale consultation and research done with HEFCE / LSE regarding metrics (www.responsiblemetrics.org)

+ Particularly notes literature review and correlation report

Findings:

+ Contested across the sector (majority of 153 responses ‘sceptical’ about the use of metrics for measuring (quality of) research)
+ Academics felt they were an imposed black box, the gathering methodology unknown to them
+ Peer review, despite limitations, had widespread support, particularly in Arts and Humanities

**“Inappropriate indicators create perverse incentives”.**

+Legitimate questions about gaming the system, self-citation and disadvantaged groups (ECRs)

**“Responsible Metrics”**

+ Robustness
+ Humility
+ Transparency
+ Diversity
+ Reflectivity

**Recommendations**

+ HEI leaders should develop a clear statement of principles on their approach to research management and assessment
  + Only 3 HEIs have signed up to DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment)
  + Promotion and Hiring Panels need explicit declarations of how such metrics are used
+ Research managers should champion these principles and show how metrics will be used
+ Researchers should be mindful of limitations of particular indicators in their CVs and in evaluations of other colleague’s work

Notetaker: Number #3 very important and so easy!

+ Data Providers and rankers (league tales) should strive for greater transparency and interoperability between 
  + HEIs / Researchers also need to be mindful of hypocrisy year to year approval of certain tables
+ Publishers should reduce emphasis on journal impact factors as a promotional tool and use them only in the context of a variety of metrics that provide a richer view of performance

**Infrastructure**

Indicators can only meet their potential if they are underpinned by a robust interoperate infrastructure

+ Use Orcid (mandatory for REF?)
+ Use DOIs for all research outputs.  

Notetaker: Rio Journal and Figshare help

The community needs a mechanism to carry forward this agenda.  Proposes a Forum for Responsible Metrics.

Also an annual ‘Bad Metric’ award (please let responsiblemetrics.org if you see any really bad examples!)

### Funder (Really Wellcome Trust, speaker admits) Approaches to Altmetrics
*Adam Dinsmore, Evaluation Officer, Wellcome Trust*

Current Grant Portfolio Largely Science, also Medical Humanities and Technology

**Varying Audiences**

+ Visitors to gallery
+ School children
+ Readers of publications
+ Policy documents
+ Metrics

**Key Indicators**

+ Discoveries
+ Applications
+ Engagement
+ Research Leaders
+ Research Environment
+ Influence

Altmetrics will help with these

**Our Altmetric Explorations so far...*

+ We will probably NEVER use altmetrics to decide funding outcomes

Case Studies

+ Measuring Twitter mentions of Wellcome-Trust associated articles
  + Showed an insight into the impressive influence of an article that ‘appeared parochial’ long before it was ever formally cited
+ Benchmarking between funders (blogs, Wikipedia, twitter, facebook, etc)
+ Better understanding of scholarly communication. Medium to large correlations (as represented by google scholar) between Mendeley readership and citations
+ Updating PubMed1000 using Altmetric data to give a richer view

Two recurrent Observations

+ Links between grants and citeable items still difficult to establish
+ ‘Indicators can only meet their potential’ if in interoperable infrastructure

WellcomeTrust now mandates (not ABSOLUTELY mandatory...) ORCID ideas to link grants and outputs for analysis

Helps avoid ‘Wellcome Trust did not fund this study’ acknowledgements (snickers from audience)
