### Welcome

What we’ve learned from trying to measure impact

+ You probably can’t measure impact
+ Alt metrics = a bad name; not alternative and not really ‘measuring’ or judging quantitatively

Easy for people to conflate different aspects:

+ Quality
+ Attention
+ Impact

+ Engaging with a specific audience --> attention leads to impact
+ AltMetric can help with these.  Quality is another realm of expterise.
