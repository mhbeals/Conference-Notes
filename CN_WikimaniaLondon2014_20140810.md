### Open Scholarship Tools - a whirlwind tour ###
Slides at https://github.com/IanMulvany/wikimania-open-scholarship-tools

**DOI: Or How do I cite this**
+ A DOI is 10x/y (10.x = is DOI prefix, y can be anything). 
 + There are shorteners but they haven't taken off much yet 
 + There are handlers that resolve them
+ Basics
 + Persistent identifiers
 + Atached metadata
 + Support a centralised ciation tracking service 
 + Persistent identifier + metadata + link a->b = A scholarly citation
 + Can use metadata to query categories of documents
+ Not every DOI is the same
 + 9 Different registration agencies --> not all of them are for scholarly outputs
+ DOIs are URLs (dx.doi.org/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
 + Avoid special characters -(); 
 + Content neotiation to get metadata
 + Use of fragment identifiers
 
**Git yourself**

+ Git is a software for tracking changes in code
+ (Very) Steep learning curve but eventually fun
+ Presentation at Github (Ian.Mulvaney)
+ Terminiology
 + Repo
 + Cloning a repo
 + Branch
 + Commit 
 + Pull Request
+ Resources about Git / within
 + Git Ready
 + github
 + Center for Open Sciener
 + Peer Library
 + Sciencetookbox
 + OpenElectrophy
 + elifesciences
 + articlemetrics
 + biopython
+ Github Resources
 + Add a DOI 

**Visual your data**

+ The Basics
 + Understand the best practices (Visualise this; D3 Gallery, ggplot2)
+ Visualisation tools
 + Excel
 + R
 + d3.js
 + Datawrapper
 + Prism
+ Good Practice
 + Use Vector graphics instead of Rastor (tiff and eps)
 + Get inspiration by looking at other discilines (especially maping)

### Open Knowledge and the National Institutes of Health of the United States ###

+ The health and medical community is (to some level) a community where knowledge is readily shared
+ Policies in place
 + Office and Science & Technology Policy (all data shared within the community)
 + Open 2.0
 + NIH data sharing policy
 + NIH Genone Wide Association Studies and genomic data sharing policy
+ Issues
 + Rights of the patient vs the value to the community
 + De-identification is a myth
+ Problems to solve regarding data
 + Locating
 + Accessing
 + Organising managing and processing
 + New analytics
 + Presenting
 + Disseminating
 + Training
+ Big Data to Knowledge Project
 + Creating a Commons
 + Research Object Sandbox / Collaborative Environment
+ Wants to work with wider community, including gamers and patients!

### The Full OA Stack â€“ Open Access and Open Source ###

**The Process**

+ Composition Tools
 + Email
 + MS Word
 + Adobe Photoshop
+ Submission
 + Closed Platforms
 + MS Word
+ Processing
 + GoogleDocs
 + Salesforce
 + Wikis (Confluence)
 + Github
+ Review
 + Email
 + MS Word
+ Typesetting
 + Zip file of metadata and files to outsourced processor for XML production 

+ Writing an article (especially in the sciences) a highly colloborative process 
 + Many opportunities for things to go wrong, loss compatability

+ Publishers suffering too!
 + After about 1991-1992, technology was outsourced and has caued difficulties
 + Limited article tracking tools

### Wikicredot ###

+ Measuring the value of work in Wikipedia

**WHY**

+ If i could say with confidence that I added some amont of value to WIkipedia
+ If my students could put it on their resumes / cv and prove it

**Meritocracy**

+ Theory
  + Good jobs, money, power
+ Practice
 + Only if it "counts" 
 + The dreaded H-index
+ Altmetrics
 + Comments
 + Repostings

**Value Added**

+ Edit retention x page views
+ Problems
 + Doesn't have talk / template pages
 + Excludes image uploads
 + Excludes anti-vandelism edits

**Social Pressure**
+ The Collective Effort Model
+ Personal Motivation + Money, then money removed....loss of personal motivation
 + Is merit based recogniion undermined by money?

**Gender Gap**
+ Rankings tend to be more motivating to men than women
+ Time limited URLs? private/public rankings?

**Segment Matching** (Fabian Flock)
+ Do paragraphs, then sentences (everything else)

### Cooperation in a Peer Production Economy: Experimental Evidence from Wikipedia ###

+ Think of contributing as a public-good dilemma 
 + Your private benefit is outweighed by private costs
 + Huge social benefit
 + If you are rational, you never contirbute, but people do!
 
+ How to could it work?
 + 1. Altruism 
 + 2. Reciprocity motive
 + 3. Social image motivation (people think you're smart, nice, etc)

+ What do we test?
 + Avoid surveys!
 + Develop a workable thoery of factors in non standard motivations
 + Inform the design of online colloborative environments

**Test Measures:**

Reciprocity: 
+ Public Goods Game
 + Keep $10, earn 0.4% for each dollar you invest and off each everyone else invests
 + If everyone invests, everyone wins more money than being selfish
 + Condition based (how much the others contirbute)
 + Combination of Wiki and Non Wiki participant
+ Trust Game
 + A sends money to B.  
 + B gets 3x that amount
 + B sends money back to A (but not under obligation to send any)

**ALtruism**
+ Dictator Game
 + A gives money to others he'll never interact with, ever
 + Dictator with in-group bias

**Social Image Motive**
+ Observational data (hard to do experimentally)
 + Personal wikipedia user page data (big page, more concerned about SI)
 + Barnstars Data (display barnstars = concerned about SI)

**Wide Sample**
+ New
+ Engaged
+ Community Leaders

**Results**
+ Reciprocity preference is stronger for newer editors
+ Altrusim does not drive wikipedia contributions (by that measure)
+ Social signal VERY strong (based on user page size) from new --> engaged --> superusers
 + This has the most effect on the most groups!
+ The less trust Administrators have, the more active they are (deleting, block users, protecting pages)

### Measuring Editor Collaborativeness with Economic Modelling ###

+ More experience as an editor doesn't necessarily mean you make better pages
+ How does article quality effect your editing skill? (acculturation?)

Two groups (users and articles)
Types (super/users and popular/articles)

*Some magic network diagrams later*

Triangular: Power users are editing most of the articles and the most popular articles have been editted by most people in category
