### Taking Time Seriously? Conceptualizing and Explaining Change over Time in Communication and Media Studies
*Sabina Mihelj and James Stanyer*

Within the main stream of media and communications studies, it is very present-centred.  History is there, but not the main focus.

+ Speaking about change, but not undertaking empirical research about it
+ How do we go about understanding and identifying change?

Undertook a literature review of three major (impact factor) journals for 2000-2014
+ 151 Articles of which 143 were research articles, 8 on theory and one on methodology (on temporal change)
+ Represents only about 1 per cent of all published in the three journals over 15 years
+ Empirical research on temporal change not the mainstream in these journals
+ Three broad approaches
  + Trend mapping
    + Development of a chosen development over time
    + Looking at trends
    + Time as a continuum
  + Temporal Comparisons
    + Comparing two or more moments in time
    + Concern was less with documenting a trend as comparing each moment with each other
    + Time treated as a succession of units
  + Turning points (critical junctures)
    + Moments when sudden, lasting change occurs
    + Explains why and how these changes occur
    + Time seen as a continuum characterised by incremental change, disrupted by moments of dramatic and long-lasting change
+ The focus of the study
  + Production, including campaigning practices, media systems, technologies and so on
  + Texts, agendas, bias, style, discourses, emotions, memories, soundbites, representations
  + Audiences, audience attitudes, opinions, participation, media effects
+ Cross-connections
  + Mostly on Trend mapping / Production or Texts
  + Fewer than 50-year date range

Problems and Challenges

+ Lack of theoretical and methodological reflection
+ Little discussion and awareness of advances in own field
+ Little engagement with existing literature in other disciplines
+ Four main challenges
  + Temporal sensitivity and sequencing; events are shaped by the sequence in which they occur and actors respond to developments in a particular order
    + Abbott (2001) Study of Temporality in the Social Sciences
  + Pace of Change; different social processes may move at different paces; are we really seeing the real ‘causes’ if we are looking at the wrong scale?
  + Periodizaton; if used at all, used as neutral container for the study and geographical/periodization relationship rarely questioned
  + Explaining Change; most research descriptive rather than explanatory and methods often lack temporal sensitivity
    + How do you prove causality?

Conclusions

+ Just a first step and there needs to be more discussion
+ Field needs to bridge qualitative / quantitative divide
+ Lack of audience research
+ Learning from other disciplines (such as this seminar series)

### Books on the Move: Understanding Travelling Readers in a Multi-disciplinary Context
*Catherine Armstrong*

#### Recently submitted AHRC network grant

Books on the Move Project

+ Putting a piece of reading into someone' hand (historiographically speaking) is very, very difficult
  + Reader Experience Database (www.open.ac.uk/Arts/reading/UK/)
    + Almost entirely reading done indoors

Questions to be asked:

+ How does the process of travelling effect the gaining of information or entertainment from reading?
+ How is travel reading selected?
+ Is the reading purposefully or a pasttime?
  + Are they seeing or reading?
+ Reading as an affectation? barrier for protection?
  + War and peace or 50 Shades of Grey?
+ What are producers of books thinking when they produce materials for reading while travelling?
+ Different types of people on the move
  + Commuters
  + Soldiers
  + Migrants

Scholarly Context

+ Travel writing, Tourism Studies and History of Reading
+ History of reading (1957, Altick, *The English Common Reader)
  + 19th century and the democratisation of education and reading
  + Better lit homes
  + Standarised working week, leisure time
  + Literacy rates, circulation and sales records, library records
+ How do we collect and interpret quantitative and especially qualitative materials

Travelling Charts or Road Books for Perusal on the Journey (1840s)

+ Publishing novels for railway travel
  + Cheap 'yellow back' editions
+ Travelling Chairs
  + "A companion for the railway carriage"
  + Allows traveller to follow the route via landmarks
  + Information on departure points
  + Designed for the leisure tourist, not the commuter
    + Language and content (architecture, natural history) indicates middle-class London audience

### Planning the Series

 + The First 29th of October
