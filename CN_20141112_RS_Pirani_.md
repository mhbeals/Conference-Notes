## Thesis ##
There needs to be an integration of political, social and technological factors to understand growth of fossil fuel consumption

## Notes ##

### Why? ###
Expansion of use rather than new technologies that has driven rise in climate impact  

+ Electricity
+ Internal combustion
+ Haber-Bosch process

Population (3x) is much less than growth in consumption (15x) in 20th century (Independent *consumption* figures have not been produced, but production consumption so production figures will do)

### Role of Historian ###

What we know now "makes the past look different"

+ Inappropriate to 'judge' past decisions as 'what were they thinking'; we didn't know about global warming then
+ Need more rigorous analysis 
 
### Ways of Counting ###

Paul Ehrlich and John Holdren

>Impact = population x affluence x technology
                
+ PS doesn't believe this formula works well

Kaya
  
>Emmissions = population x (GDP / population) × (energy/population) × (emissions/energy)

+ Critiqued for serious limitations (by Dietz and Rosa) because you cannot disentangle factors

Is population the driving force?

+ Most people consume indirectly
+ Series of graphs comparing population to energy use in Russia, China and US
  + No obvious correlation
+ Increased use is in urban and industrial use, not general population

Role of technology?

+ Gasoline and diesel use in US often result of (poor) planning; having to go in the car in order to do weekly shop
 
### Energy Loss ###

Cambridge-produced graphic showing energy loss between source and final service

+ An enormous amount of energy just 'thrown into the air' in many countries
  + 73% could be save with existing technology

Historians can find out why we are using such inefficient systems
+ why do some technologies win over others?
+ why do they develop unevenly
  + hard to retrofit if you don't integrate at the start
  + even in "planned" cities energy not fully thought through

### Corporate Machinations ###

Corporations do plot, and may be evil, but we need a deeper and more critical analysis  

### Global Differences ###

Complex Big-Systems copied wholesale into developing countries
+ excludes the poorest
+ 2.4 billion cook with traditional biomass; 1.4 billion have no access to electricity (2010)

### Why Do We Have THESE Systems?"

Cultural historians map consumption habits
+ Emphasis on consumers neglects restrictions placed on them by big systems (such as the weekly shop on the motor way)

Why do big systems persist?
What is the role of the corporation?
What is the role played by the commodification of energy?

### The Government-Industrial Complex ###

1970s 'oil shocks' focused attention on demand; problems largely rejected by government in 1980s

+ Government and industry focus more and more on fossil fuels over new technology
+ State subsidies rise after 2000s in response to high oil prices
