### Keynote: Reflections on Teaching History in Schools ###
*Dr Mike Maddison, OFSTED (formerly, not currently) and Deputy President, Historical Association*

“I come as an observer. . .from your point of view”

+ Students say the best things:
  Teacher: “What does gaudy mean?” (in reference to Elizabeth I’s dress)
  Student: “All chaved up” 
#### What is happening in history in schools?

+ A number of curriculum changes.  Revised NC for all year groups in 2014
  + New GCSEs in 2016
  + AS and A levels in 2015
  + Excludes academies and free schools
    + 2.4 of 8.3 million pupils
  + All state-funded schools must have a curriculum that “promotes the spiritual, moral cultural mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society”

**Primary School**
+ Some successes to note:
  + Pupils and teachers enjoy
  + Range of historical topics British (to 1066 plus theme that goes beyond 1066), local, ancient and non-British history
  + Resurgence in interest in history among teachers
  + Better knowledge and progress when history is discrete
+Some difficulties
  + Still episodic
  + Chronological understanding is increasingly variable
  + Make links across weak
  + Level of challenge not progressing Y3 to Y6
  + Teaching variable because subject knowledge poor (having now changed), training limited (CPD)

**Secondary**

+ Successful because well taught by well-qualified teachers and well led
+ Popular at KS3, GCSE and A Level
+ Trend in entries in exams is upward
+ Attainment is high
+ Effective preparation for HE and employment

Complex Tables = GSCE entries up from 22-23k to 24k-26k; A levels 42k in 2004 to 55k now

Concerns

+ Increasing non-specialist teachings (28% no relevant degree)
+ Reduction and variability in teaching time (60-90min a week)
  + Notetaker: REALLY!?!
+ Insufficient emphasis upon analytical and discursive writing (too much focus on creative writing)
+ Insufficient planning for progression 
+ Failure of subject leaders to provide a rational for the curriculum they had put in place
+ History marginalised in some schools 
  + But from Sept 2015, all students must take History or Geography (can do both) to GCSE

GCSE and A-Level

+ Henry and Hitler (Stalin and King?); generally moving toward modern world topics
+ Set texts (pernicious influence)
+ Decline in essay writing opportunities
+ Range of experiences at GSCE
+ Formulaic responses as a result of formulaic teaching (not teachers’ fault, just being practical)
+ Move back from modular to linear assessment

Changes to GCSE

+ History from 3 eras (Med. EM and Modern)
+ Three time scales (depth, period, thematic)
+ Three geographical contexts (Locality, British/European, World – not just colonial Britain)
+ British history must be 40% of assessed content over full course

Changes to A-Levels

Coalition government determined A-Levels designed for HE preparation. (grumbles from audience)

+ >= 200 years
+ British history (>=20%)
+ Change over time
+ Nature and purpose of history as a discipline
+ Carry out a historical enquiry (20%)

**Teacher Training**

+ High quality recruits (2.1+)
+ High completion and employment rates
+ High quality subject knowledge and pedagogy knowledge
+ Well structured, delivered and challenging training courses
+ Quality of provision: HE good, school-based variable
+ “Supportive and dedicated” history mentors / departments

Concerns:

+ Greater diversification (PGCE to school based training
+ Spread across HEIS, groups of schools and individual schools
+ Questionable (according to speaker) estimates of the number of history teachers needed (2104-15; 630)

Results:

+ Instability in the system
+ Loss of community because of spread of trainees (762 over 175 partnerships and 284 schools.
  + Issue not about quality but distribution (penalises schools in disadvantaged areas)

#### Evaluating teaching and learning in history in schools

“helps pupils acquire knowledge, understanding and skills in all aspects of their education, including linguistic, mathematical, scientific, technical, human and social, physical and artistic learning.”

“promotion of fundamental British values”

Question from audience: “what are fundamental British values?”

+ Government definition: Democracy, rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect, toleration of those of different faiths and beliefs.

**How might we evaluate teaching and learning in history?**

Characteristics of a history curriculum:
+ Acquisition of knowledge and development of chronological understanding
+ Key historical concepts
+ Thinking through enquiries
+ Rationale and thinking
+ Assessment which reveals aim are being achieved
+ Progression
+ Balance of appropriate topics
+ Wide range of enrichment activities
+ (partial list only)
  
+ Knowledge, not just skills
+ Well-structured enquires
+ Development of historical thinking

#### Implications for Higher Education

**How can HE help improve history in schools?**

+ Curriculum design
+ Improving transition from A-level, what are schools not doing that realistically you wish they would?
+ How committed are you to being involved in A level course assessment and review?
+ Academic scholarship, reconnecting to latest scholarship
+ Using your expertise around individual enquiries

** What you HE learn from history in Schools **

+ TEF requirements...see as an opportunity not a threat
+ Engage with the process
+ Draft your own history framework, make it manageable

Notetaker: Good idea.  Like a teaching philosophy, but a learning one?

+ Get ahead of the game

Make your teaching of history accessible, meaningful, coherent and achievable
