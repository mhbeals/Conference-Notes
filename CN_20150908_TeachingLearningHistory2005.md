### Keynote: Reflections on Teaching History in Schools ###
*Dr Mike Maddison, OFSTED (formerly, not currently) and Deputy President, Historical Association*

“I come as an observer. . .from your point of view”

+ Students say the best things:
  Teacher: “What does gaudy mean?” (in reference to Elizabeth I’s dress)
  Student: “All chaved up” 
#### What is happening in history in schools?

+ A number of curriculum changes.  Revised NC for all year groups in 2014
  + New GCSEs in 2016
  + AS and A levels in 2015
  + Excludes academies and free schools
    + 2.4 of 8.3 million pupils
  + All state-funded schools must have a curriculum that “promotes the spiritual, moral cultural mental and physical development of pupils at the school and of society”

**Primary School**
+ Some successes to note:
  + Pupils and teachers enjoy
  + Range of historical topics British (to 1066 plus theme that goes beyond 1066), local, ancient and non-British history
  + Resurgence in interest in history among teachers
  + Better knowledge and progress when history is discrete
+Some difficulties
  + Still episodic
  + Chronological understanding is increasingly variable
  + Make links across weak
  + Level of challenge not progressing Y3 to Y6
  + Teaching variable because subject knowledge poor (having now changed), training limited (CPD)

**Secondary**

+ Successful because well taught by well-qualified teachers and well led
+ Popular at KS3, GCSE and A Level
+ Trend in entries in exams is upward
+ Attainment is high
+ Effective preparation for HE and employment

Complex Tables = GSCE entries up from 22-23k to 24k-26k; A levels 42k in 2004 to 55k now

Concerns

+ Increasing non-specialist teachings (28% no relevant degree)
+ Reduction and variability in teaching time (60-90min a week)
  + Notetaker: REALLY!?!
+ Insufficient emphasis upon analytical and discursive writing (too much focus on creative writing)
+ Insufficient planning for progression 
+ Failure of subject leaders to provide a rational for the curriculum they had put in place
+ History marginalised in some schools 
  + But from Sept 2015, all students must take History or Geography (can do both) to GCSE

GCSE and A-Level

+ Henry and Hitler (Stalin and King?); generally moving toward modern world topics
+ Set texts (pernicious influence)
+ Decline in essay writing opportunities
+ Range of experiences at GSCE
+ Formulaic responses as a result of formulaic teaching (not teachers’ fault, just being practical)
+ Move back from modular to linear assessment

Changes to GCSE

+ History from 3 eras (Med. EM and Modern)
+ Three time scales (depth, period, thematic)
+ Three geographical contexts (Locality, British/European, World – not just colonial Britain)
+ British history must be 40% of assessed content over full course

Changes to A-Levels

Coalition government determined A-Levels designed for HE preparation. (grumbles from audience)

+ >= 200 years
+ British history (>=20%)
+ Change over time
+ Nature and purpose of history as a discipline
+ Carry out a historical enquiry (20%)

**Teacher Training**

+ High quality recruits (2.1+)
+ High completion and employment rates
+ High quality subject knowledge and pedagogy knowledge
+ Well structured, delivered and challenging training courses
+ Quality of provision: HE good, school-based variable
+ “Supportive and dedicated” history mentors / departments

Concerns:

+ Greater diversification (PGCE to school based training
+ Spread across HEIS, groups of schools and individual schools
+ Questionable (according to speaker) estimates of the number of history teachers needed (2104-15; 630)

Results:

+ Instability in the system
+ Loss of community because of spread of trainees (762 over 175 partnerships and 284 schools.
  + Issue not about quality but distribution (penalises schools in disadvantaged areas)

#### Evaluating teaching and learning in history in schools

“helps pupils acquire knowledge, understanding and skills in all aspects of their education, including linguistic, mathematical, scientific, technical, human and social, physical and artistic learning.”

“promotion of fundamental British values”

Question from audience: “what are fundamental British values?”

+ Government definition: Democracy, rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect, toleration of those of different faiths and beliefs.

**How might we evaluate teaching and learning in history?**

Characteristics of a history curriculum:
+ Acquisition of knowledge and development of chronological understanding
+ Key historical concepts
+ Thinking through enquiries
+ Rationale and thinking
+ Assessment which reveals aim are being achieved
+ Progression
+ Balance of appropriate topics
+ Wide range of enrichment activities
+ (partial list only)
  
+ Knowledge, not just skills
+ Well-structured enquires
+ Development of historical thinking

#### Implications for Higher Education

**How can HE help improve history in schools?**

+ Curriculum design
+ Improving transition from A-level, what are schools not doing that realistically you wish they would?
+ How committed are you to being involved in A level course assessment and review?
+ Academic scholarship, reconnecting to latest scholarship
+ Using your expertise around individual enquiries

** What you HE learn from history in Schools **

+ TEF requirements...see as an opportunity not a threat
+ Engage with the process
+ Draft your own history framework, make it manageable

Notetaker: Good idea.  Like a teaching philosophy, but a learning one?

+ Get ahead of the game

Make your teaching of history accessible, meaningful, coherent and achievable

Question from the audience: What can HE academics provide in their writing?

Answer: Maybe not just writing, but also first-year lecture materials? Some HE’s (notetaker, I know who!) have taken such materials offline.

### Are you an Ignorant Schoolmaster? Using Philosophy to Construct Pedagogy in the History Classroom ###
*Annmarie Vales, Loyola University Chicago*

Initial pedagogical perspective: I love history SO much

New pedagogical perspective: I still love history, and I am reflective about teaching it and responsive to students ‘teaching me’

Regular reading: *Schoolmaster* by Jacques Ranciere and *An answer to the question: What is Enlightenment*

+ Understanding the difference between the material being taught and the person being taught
+ Rarely use student, peer, human being

Main teaching goal: I am speaking to you, not examining you.

Ranciere:
1. Student emancipation (as opposed to explicator of stultification)
2. Equality of intelligence (as opposed to weaker/stronger student)
3. Rhetorical madness
4. Progressive’s circle

The problem:
+ University course are settled?
  + Academic freedom w/in pre-determined course tracks (I don’t want to teach colonial times – civil war)
+ Time constraints
+ We have to grade them
+ Training or pedagogy of experience
+ Personal dissatisfaction
+ Hierarchy 

Issues:
+ Undergraduates as children – as market-obsessed
+ Rise of technology
+ Group Learning
+ Exams exams exams
+ Dependence on rubics
+ Students report grades motivate more than learning

Student emancipations
+ Presupposition of equality
+ Re-emphasis on individual thought and effort

Classroom examples
+ Syllabus contributions
  + Not standard readings, but asked about doing 4 SCOTUS cases instead
+ Thinking Questions
  + They email questions from their reading
+ Limit group activities
  + group activities (student: where my ideas go to die)
+ Creation of own thesis and paper topic
+ Consistent emphasis on originality
+ No internet sources unless it’s a primary source. If google can answer it, it’s not a thinking question.

Notetaker (Good!)

Importance of dialogue in teaching (in material and in pedagogy)

Students have their own binaries they come to class with, but every student’s binary is different (Free thinking) and they see that after just a few weeks.  All asking different questions and therefore not ‘binary’ overall

### Argue to think: helping VIth formers to write more effective argument in their history essays ###
*Diana Hilliard, Argue to Think Project*

Although being argue in a complex society vital, students (regardless of where they are coming from or the level support being offered) find it difficult to write effective arguments.

*PhD Research*

+ ‘The talk’ of argument in history
	
Interviews:

History education academic look at **structure**
Examiners **measure by quality of argument**, so don’t want it ‘taught’.
Teachers, spoke about **structure**
Students, we know about **structure** but have other issues

Classroom observations:

Teachers worried about structure and lack of independent thought; students now about structure by timid about ‘own opinion’. Don’t know what I think.

*Focus on Process, not structure*

Literature: Lots of good stuff on history, but nothing on ‘historical argument’.  Think it’s implied?

‘Everyone knows how to ride a bike, don’t they?  Do you remember HOW you learned to ride a bike?’

Show them ‘argument clinic’ from MPFC and Prime Minister’s Questions to ask students about ‘is this a good argument?’

Different types of argument
+ Opinion based
+ Persuasion
+ Historical (multipolar) argument (How far do you agree...)

Plan the argument as a group – go solo in writing

Results:

+ Improvement in essays based on ‘argument indicators’

Question from the audience: What of those students who are less inclined to ‘talk’ during learning process?

Answer: We always start with (student-created) ground rules, and debunking of ‘row’ arguments

Question: do you talk about the negative aspects of arguments, such as the MEANS (lying) but which you destroyed their argument

Answer: Disagreement isn’t negative. And we are quite structured to avoid this.

### The Making of Modern Britons: Identity and Community 1901-1964. It really makes you think critically ###	
*David Clampin, Liverpool John Moores Univeristy, and Steve Lawler*

The problem:

+ Too much descriptive narrative
+ Reckless use of language
+ Poor planning and structure

Cultural History of Britain, 1901-1964

Assessment model:
+ 500 Word definition of ‘modernity’
  + Distil to ‘Key message’
  + 4 Key Concepts under modernity (with short descriptions)
  + gets them to think about language
+ ‘A Visual Essay’ around a case study (iSpring)
  + Because it’s a ‘package’ there has to be a navigable flow; organisation
  + Because you have to ‘move along’, they naturally answer the ‘so what’ question.

Feedback from Cohort

+ Not universally popular
+ Unnerving and disorientating
+ Unconventional
+ Unclear what the final output would be

Notetaker: common refrain!  Must always think this through at start

+ Provide support
+ Provide examples
+ Persist in the face of adversity
+ Will it have any long-term benefit? No idea.

Comment from audience: Digital humanities is about being unsettling.

### Learning through Practice: A Participatory Workshop Exploring Ways of Teaching the ‘Grammar’ of Historical Research ###
*Diana Jeater, Goldsmiths University*

NB, this is a workshop and notes may be sporadic.

“Some students are just not learning by doing” ... “but they come with a whole set of assumptions”

Having student use all aspects and approaches on their ‘favourite’ module, helps them understand it isn’t about this topics = this approach.

Part I: Reading a primary source empirically 

+ Historians in the room noticed the ‘metadata’ of the primary source as empirical data, but students wouldn’t; the concentrate on content
+ Received background information / data from their other modules; put in groups based on shared modules being taken. (Cohort building)

Part II: Reading against the grain

Part III: Reading from a Cultural History methodology

+ Some students always saw the value of different methodologies on their sources, but the rest really benefited from making this explicit. 
+ Highlights why certain methods work on certain sources; not the topic but the analyses possible (but also allows non-conventional uses)

Question from audience: Don’t we as practitioners have an equal need to broaden our methodological range

Answer: Yes, but not all colleagues will, but this is about making the process (The why) clearer to them.

Comment from audience: even ‘good’ students gain from it because they know ‘why’ they are doing the right thing already.

Part IV: How did basic human needs (food, clothing and shelter) effect what happened in the past?

(Marxist analysis by stealth!)

### I wanted to do it right because I knew you’d be watching: Video log assessments ###
*Elaine Farrell, Queens University Belfast*
@Elaineffarrell

Liked the idea of seminar logs, but they were already assessed on written communication in essay...

+ Weekly, but only 3/4 counted, so first one ‘didn’t really count’
+ Non submissions did go up highly for the last one

Feedback:

+ Anticipated Skills were recognised as improved
+ Also highlighted (unanticipated by tutor)
  + Enjoyment / Rewarding / More freedom

Visual editing included ‘turning the phone around to point at computer screen’

Video logs were ‘more personal’ and ‘waffling’ was more readily apparent when students watched themselves

Unexpected *benefits* for students with disabilities, such as dyslexia.

Task required more from tutor as well as students 
+ Logs took longer than written assignment because of the need to prepare the script, and the timing never quite worked out
  + One student had 98 takes!
+ Harder to avoid mistakes or avoid repetition
+ Upload time (youtube/dropbox) was long 

24 hour for general feedback, 1 week for personal feedback
+ Time-consuming (25k words of feedback in total)

Students felt marks were roughly comparable (or better) than written logs.

**Reflections**

Would have encouraged sharing more (very few shared)
+ In think tank students were reluctant to share in class, when they are in the room (70% no)

### Asynchronic and Remote Teaching of Ancient History – Trial Error and Future Prospects ###
*Daniela Dueck, Bar Ilan University Israel*

Blended Learning

+ Increased student control over time, place and pace

+ Strong dependence on computer or digital literacy	

Students are a mixture of classics/ancient history and students specialising in other periods, or from other disciplines with no formal history training

+ Adjustment needed, but not on academic rigor 

Assessments

+ Proficiency exam on specific plays (multiple choice quiz)
+ Application of modern theories on an ancient play
+ Comparison of Plays
+ Analysis of sections from tragedies
+ Analysis of a modern production of an ancient play

Feedback:

+ Not clear instructions
+ Short timeframe
+ Too many assignments

Only the first may be related to digital format (others are typical complaints of face-to-face)

Reflection:

+ Missed group discussions and guided readings
+ Written communication is limited
+ Not all traditional courses can be transformed into online courses
+ Course topic is a major consideration

### That’s all folks (my session is next, and last) ###

Good choices for blended / distance learning?

+ **Non-textual sources of the ancient world**
+ Good broad relevance to range of students
+ More material sources available than textual ones, especially for certain groups
+ Designed FOR a distance module

Close reading requires more direct guided help so not well suited to distance learning

Good choices for format?

+ Visual material and observation assignments (written instructions)
+ Assignments that promote group activities (discussion boards)
+ Assignments that promote information literacy and research skills
