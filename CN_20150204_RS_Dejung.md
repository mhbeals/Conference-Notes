Possible to undertake social history in global history: a case study of middle class / bourgeois society

Two Observations:
  
+ Deficit of social historical accounts in global history  
+ Emergence of middle classes all over the world in the age of empire

Three objections:
  
+ critiques from post-colonial studies on grouping 'middle classes'    
  + only valid if you think European middle-classes came out of something removed from global connections  
+ The problem of 'world society'  
+ Disregard of the dark side of modernity -- middle class coziness 

**Deficit of social historical accounts in global history**:

Patrick Manning, Lynn Hunt lament the lack of social in global history

**Emergence of middle classes all over the world in the age of empire**

Several new studies regarding:

+ Global labour history
+ Social groups comparable to middle class in various regions of the world
  +  Middle East, Latin America, Africa

+ Are these groups colonial/European really comparable?
  + economic station 
  + relationship with the state
+ Can you really combine school teachers and lawyers WITHIN a region?

We can do these WITHIN Europe, despite wide ranging differences, so why not the world?

**Critiques from post-colonial studies on grouping 'middle classes'**

+ Both colonial and European middle classes arose from international interaction

**The relationship between race and class**

+ Colonial / native / European aristocrats could be compared, even if there was still a hierarchy
+ Evidence of more interest in profession / class than race amongst merchants
+ May be more profitable to separate class and race and look at each in context

**The problem of 'world society'**

+ If these classes came out of global interaction can they be said to be a world society?
+ Deemed functionalist, over-complex and Euro-centric

**Social stratification on a global level**

+ Mercantile networks
+ Scientific networks
+ Cosmopolitan thought zones' in politics

Will this lead to finding global society in the next step?

**Disregard of the dark side of modernity**

+ World distinguished by inequalities of various types
  + Racism, sexism, classism
+ Will eventually be important to connect global history of middle class to labour history

##Conclusion##

+ Opportunities to study similarities and differences
+ Domestic social order / global entanglements 
+ Provincialising concepts such as class and society
  + European middle class not a ideal but rather the European version
