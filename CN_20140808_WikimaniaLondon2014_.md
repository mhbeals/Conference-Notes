### Free Our Research - Reaching Out to Academics ###
Community Notes: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/Wikimania_2014_Open_Scholarship_1

+ What are the issues surrounding OA adoption and how can we address those issues?
 + Need to develop altmetrics to highlight and demonstrate open access research
 + Altmetrics will encourage early career researchers to take part in OA activities despite it being less commonly seen as career advancing 
 + Need to develop a wider base of support, besides early adopters
 + Growth of public organisation / funding body adoption in past few years has been encouraging
 + OA research benefits: metrics, collaboration, outreach
 
+ Points from the floor 
 + Publish online 'non-serious work' because of need to publish to peers / hierarchical 'important journals'
 + Even if you can't publish your full work as open access immediately, make sure you lengthy abstracts and detailed summaries of results are available somewhere (with updatable link?)
 + Are authors who publish in predatory journals infiltrating Wikipedia (bad information / bad citation)?
 + People in the humanities need to take advantage of APC fee-waivers and Non-APC Journals
 + Stephen Curry -- Impact Factor: Print it out and give it to your administrators
 
### Common Knowledge? An Ethnography of Wikipedia (On Trust, Distrust, Betrayal and Loyalty) ###
Community Discussion: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/Wikimania_2014_Social_Machines_1

+ Essjay Controversy
 + Right to project identity?
 + 25% of editors feel harassed
 
+ Are credential important?
 + Attempts to verify claims widely protested
 + No stable outcome to the discussion
 + Some even wanted to banned credentialist!
 + Guidelines now state you shouldn't "intentionally misrepresent identity or credentials"

+ Credential / Experts
 + We are all 'playing roles' and develop reputations within wikipedia, just as we do in every community
 + Credentials create hierarchies in a community that is supposed to be democratic
 + Creation of a separate space for experts to "fight" on the nuance of Wikipedia topics

+ Points from the Floor
 + Won't experts skew the POV towards their research opinion?
 + False balance on 'debate' pages?
 + Who will nominate the experts? Won't it be the same names and prevent the democratic / meritocratic nature of Wikipedia?

### The State of Wikimedia Scholarship 2013-2014 ###
Community Notes: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/Wikimania_2014_Social_Machines_II

+ Different metrics have different counts for Wikimedia scholarship over the past year
+ Selection of different themes

**Event Prediction**

+ Predicting events based on viewership on Wikipedia (such as influenza)
 + is later than current trends because hospital data is often 7-14 days out of date
 + Really biased by media coverage 
+ Box office returns, election results, etc...

**Wikimedia as a Corpus**

+ "Pivot-based Multilingual Dictionary Building Using Wiktionary" (Acs, Judit)
 + Dog-Perro-Hund & Dog-Kutya-Hund
 + Create much more accurate translation dictionary
 + Limits: Multiple definitions
 
**Content Quality**

+ Attempts build on Britannica Study
+ Random 245 Article Pairs for both encyclopedias
 + Accuracy and Accessibility
+ Portuguese study had similar results (Wikipedia systematically better)

**Role of Conflict in Determining Consensus on Quality**
(Osman, Kim)

+ Undertook discourse analysis of talk pages
 + A lot of conflict (more than expected)
 + Productive conflict
 + Discussions frequently cite Wikipedia processes and guidelines (formal and informal)
 
**Wikiprojects**

+ Critical mass important for sustainability and longevity of projects
+ Do you want a smaller number of committed editors or a larger group of casual contributors?
+ Projects with more contributors early on have better growth later on than *just* a smaller 'poweruser' base

**Vandalism**

+ Study looked at editor country, time of day, article content domain and content of the edits
+ Most vandalism took place during office hours (school hours) and best real edits in evening

**Barn Star Boost**

+ Given rewards randomly
+ Only high level editors seemed boosted
+ Also led to LOWER retention (they don't know why)

### Human-centred Design for Free Knowledge ###

+ Creating something that is designed to be useful to the group of users you are designing it for
+ Analysis --> Design --> Implement --> Evaluate (again and again)
  + Focus groups, interviews and surveys
+ How do you humanize Wikipedia articles? (more people, fewer bots, through mobile platforms?)
+ How do people who don't use Wikipedia get information?
 + Mobile access to internet a barrier to getting information (Found out through WikipediaZero research)

**Examples of Work**
+ Hear --> Women and Wikipedia
+ Create --> Wikimedia Nederland
+ Deliver---> Wikipedia Library
+ Wikimedia Trademark Policy 
 + Balance decentralised nature of wikimedia but have trademark protect and obey trademark law

### Reform of Citation Structure for All Wikimedia Projects ###

### Transforming Wikipedia into the Timeline of Everything ###

+ Creates a visual timeline of any Wikipedia articles
+ Can also use categories (but did not see details of how)
+ Can easily see mistakes in Wikipedia / Wikidata and can fix these through direct links
+ Relies on Wikidata so should be language-nuetral eventually (but English-only at the moment)
+ A private company but wants this portion to remain free (even CC0) with monitisation elsewhere
 + Looking at forking a open source version  

### Measuring community Health: Vital Signs for Wikimedia Projects ###

+ A proviso: Metrics are not research--the enable and facilitate it

+ Looks at data surrounding Wikipedia communities and their activity (volume, quality, retention, etc)
 + Uses exisitng sources: Wikistats (stats.wikimedia.org) and Report Card (reportcard.wmflabs.org) 
+ Developing 'Vital Signs' that will have more complete datasets and fully downloadable
 + Four major catefories of metrics: New Users; Communitiy (active editors, unique editors); Content (edits); Curation (moved, deleted)

*Use Cases*

+ Data exploration
+ Health checks (how are behaviours in a particular community doing?)
+ Projections and target setting


### The URAA, Copyright Terms, and the Wikimedia Projects ###

+ Copyright law before 1886: Foreign works not entitled to copyright --> widespread piracy
+ Victor Hugo formed ALAI to convince the world that publishing would be killed by piracy

**Berne Convention 1886**

+ All copyright had life +50
+ Granted immediately without registration
+ Originally only ten countries: Belgium, France, German, Italy, Spain, Switzterland, Tunisia, UK, (Haiti and Liberia briefly)
+ US didn't want to join

**The URAA**

+ Retroactively grants copyright protection to forign works regardless of adhearence to US formalities
+ Includes Metropolis, Lord of the Rings, and works by Escher, Stravinsky, Picasso, Gandhi
+ Restored?
 + WTO or Berne Convention signatory
 + Copyrightable in US
 + Post-1923
+ Effects Commons?
 + Shouldn't if it was just about syncing
 + But because its granting US copyright, it does
 + Never actually received a request for a restored URAA item
 + New ones discouraged, but no pressing need to remove ones already hosted
 + Even if the images are moved to a non-US server their are issues (loss of DMCA and Free speech protections; still under US jurisdiction)
 + Speaker advocates adopting rule of shorter term.
 + We'd get Alison and Wonderland back

### Featured Speaker: Rufus Pollock, Founder of the Open Knowledge Project ###

+ Information is becoming available, but are people in the media and other places able to make use of it?

+ Data is hard to get and use
 + Too much friction (not all in one corporation / format)
 + Data Packaging: see more at http://data.okfn.org
