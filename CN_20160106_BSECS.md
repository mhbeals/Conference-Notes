'Drawing Blanks: The Poor and the Growth and Collapse of the Lotteries'
James Raven (Cambridge)

**Part of a book project with @OUPAcademic Lottery Lives**

Begins with an anecdote of an attack on two (female) witnesses against men accused of violating gambling laws, leaving constables gravely injured.

+ Tensions over social normality of gambling and gambling debts amongst aristocracy and such laws
  + Charles James Fox had lost over 100k before age 25, left debt of 10k at death
  
+ Real moral panic in wake of French Revolution or "The Josephine Argument": Banning private gambling and directing it to state lottery, which Joseph iI controlled?
  + "What can comparative state attitudes to gambling (prohibition vs permissiveness) tell us about fiscal/social views?" HT @SMCoulombeau 
  + Insurance at Lloyd's became like 'gambling at Whites'

### British Lotteries Overview ###

**Lotteries**

+ Original raffles, largely financial failures
+ After 1690s became more financially secure
+ Over 18th century, state lotteries developed in various European countries
+ Local and private lotteries, raffles continued, especially in Low Countries
+ English and Irish lotteries seen as akin to government bonds--guaranteed return (via annuity) but spreading over decades led to poor returns

**19th Century**

+ Contractors who ran lottery became more desperate as purchases thinned
+ Some prizes were bundles of future tickets

**State Finance**

+ More people 'contributed' via lottery than other funds (1762)
+ Funded major war efforts in 18th century
+ Funded Westminster Bridge
+ Helped established (what became) British Museum
 
**European Lotteries**

+ Discussion of French and Spanish state lotteries
+ Although not as prominent as in Britain / France, Spanish lotter after 1763 still very important and under recognised part of Enlightenment reforms
+ Irish lotteries to fund church refurbishments and hospitals

**Collapse of Lotteries**
A slight modification from previous writings…

+ Moral Crusade against lottery secondary to questions over its efficiency for raising state funds
+ Wilberforce (apocryphal?): What should we abolish next?

**But**

“We shouldn’t underestimate moral concern about the poor”

+ Discussion against lottery a continuation of 18th century concerns over gambling in Britain
+ Banning of French Lottery and Regulations in Tuscany but there are essential differences between systems
  + Motivation for the suppression of private lotteries differed
  + On the continent, mostly an effort to stop *foreign* lotteries, rather than domestic private ones
  + Britain also had concerns about foreign lotteries, there were few sustained efforts or campaigns against them

** British Case**

+ Growth of 'shares' brought lottery into the discretionary spending of about 1/4 of population (Britain)
+ Development of secondary gambling (and legislative crackdown thereof from 1739 Gaming Act)
+ Social gap evident considering the rampant betting amongst gentry and aristocracy as time of attack (opening anecdote)
+ 1790s discussion of the 'little go' private lottery draws--and how they were fixed according to the *Times*

**Conclusion**

+ Discusses social background of attackers (including boxers)
  + Indication of professional underworld (gang warfare between gambling providers and informants)
+ Greater prosecutions of working-class gambling but some compassions for “Poor deluded” who had been “plundered”
