'Drawing Blanks: The Poor and the Growth and Collapse of the Lotteries' by James Raven (Cambridge)

**Part of a book project with @OUPAcademic Lottery Lives**

Begins with an anecdote of an attack on two (female) witnesses against men accused of violating gambling laws, leaving constables gravely injured.

+ Tensions over social normality of gambling and gambling debts amongst aristocracy and such laws
  + Charles James Fox had lost over 100k before age 25, left debt of 10k at death
  
+ Real moral panic in wake of French Revolution or "The Josephine Argument": Banning private gambling and directing it to state lottery, which Joseph iI controlled?
  + "What can comparative state attitudes to gambling (prohibition vs permissiveness) tell us about fiscal/social views?" HT @SMCoulombeau 
  + Insurance at Lloyd's became like 'gambling at Whites'

### British Lotteries Overview ###

**Lotteries**

+ Original raffles, largely financial failures
+ After 1690s became more financially secure
+ Over 18th century, state lotteries developed in various European countries
+ Local and private lotteries, raffles continued, especially in Low Countries
+ English and Irish lotteries seen as akin to government bonds--guaranteed return (via annuity) but spreading over decades led to poor returns

**19th Century**

+ Contractors who ran lottery became more desperate as purchases thinned
+ Some prizes were bundles of future tickets

**State Finance**

+ More people 'contributed' via lottery than other funds (1762)
+ Funded major war efforts in 18th century
+ Funded Westminster Bridge
+ Helped established (what became) British Museum
 
**European Lotteries**

+ Discussion of French and Spanish state lotteries
+ Although not as prominent as in Britain / France, Spanish lotter after 1763 still very important and under recognised part of Enlightenment reforms
+ Irish lotteries to fund church refurbishments and hospitals

**Collapse of Lotteries**
A slight modification from previous writings…

+ Moral Crusade against lottery secondary to questions over its efficiency for raising state funds
+ Wilberforce (apocryphal?): What should we abolish next?

**But**

“We shouldn’t underestimate moral concern about the poor”

+ Discussion against lottery a continuation of 18th century concerns over gambling in Britain
+ Banning of French Lottery and Regulations in Tuscany but there are essential differences between systems
  + Motivation for the suppression of private lotteries differed
  + On the continent, mostly an effort to stop *foreign* lotteries, rather than domestic private ones
  + Britain also had concerns about foreign lotteries, there were few sustained efforts or campaigns against them

** British Case**

+ Growth of 'shares' brought lottery into the discretionary spending of about 1/4 of population (Britain)
+ Development of secondary gambling (and legislative crackdown thereof from 1739 Gaming Act)
+ Social gap evident considering the rampant betting amongst gentry and aristocracy as time of attack (opening anecdote)
+ 1790s discussion of the 'little go' private lottery draws--and how they were fixed according to the *Times*

**Conclusion**

+ Discusses social background of attackers (including boxers)
  + Indication of professional underworld (gang warfare between gambling providers and informants)
+ Greater prosecutions of working-class gambling but some compassions for “Poor deluded” who had been “plundered”

## Cultures of Trade and Commerce ##  
Chair: N. G. Howe, Ho Tim Seminar Room

### Rachael Morton, Changing Perceptions of Quality in the English Metalware Trade, c.1674-1774 ###

+ Speaks of the growth of the metalware trade, particularly of consumer goods such as toys
+ Movement from "Bromich ware", low-quality items at the start of the century, to "Birmingham Ware", quality at the end of the century
+ Papers to explore expansion of trade in Birmingham and Sheffield and the tensions between 'quality' providers in London  
 + **Argues that quality was not just its tangible qualities, but all the reputations attached to it**
  + Regulation as well as the consensus of the population in determining quality
  + Because of innovation, lower price could still be higher quality

*Development of Hallmarks*

+ Because silver could be melted down into bullion / specie, authenticating purity very important
+ Hallmark; Location of assay office, year, composition, producer 
+ Originally in London, Chester, Exeter, Newcastle and York but this meant costs / chance of intellectual piracy for Sheffield and Birmingham producers
+ Birmingham out of regulatory framework and so hard greater freedom
  + London opposed opening of Birmingham office out of fears of competition
+ Inclusion of imitative marks (that weren’t actually regulated)
  + Forgeries about ‘London’ or later ‘Birmingham’ made indicate shifts in idea of quality reputation
+ Registration of Marks but the guilds (on item, in register and touch plates)
  + Black list circulated to producers and sometimes newspapers

*Reporting Poor Quality*

+ Compensation to consumers who sued for poor metalware
+ Books on how to spot poor quality
+ Trade cards displayed marks, they were understood by general public


### Gönül Bakay, The Levant Company: The Expansion and Contraction of British-Ottoman Commercial Relations in the Long Eighteenth Century ###

+ Opens with the early years of Anglo-Ottoman trade relations in 16th century, defying French objections
+ Initial monopoly to Governor and Company of the Merchants of the Levant 
  + By 1595 many of the agents traded on their own account 
  + Initially agents were single men who worked for 3 years then returned home and traded from then on in their own right
+ Merchant company also helped build up and maintain political relations

**Quotes a fantastically long address to the Sultana**

+ Families discouraged from going with factors, as they were not supported by company; none seem to have lived in poverty
+ In 17th century, company given trading rights without time limitation—reached height in 1670s

**Reasons of the Demise of the Company (1780s—1820s)**

+ Contemporaries accused them of greed and monopolistic tendencies
  + End of private shipping to general shipping in company by-laws in 1780
+ Rise of French Trade: greater number of ships, better market research
+ Relations with Persia: Division by Russia and Ottoman affecting silk trade

### Peter Collinge, The Silken Phoenix, Sarah Davenport (1779-c.1865), Enterprise and the Derby Silk Industry ###

Sets the stage: Davenport pregnant and widowed with no specific instruction to take over husband’s business; in 1817 a fire destroyed silk factory. Insurance only covered part of the machinery 

+ Cannot regain Davenport through traditional corporate history means – no business records, journal, or correspondence.  
+ Fragmentary evidence in vital records, newspaper, will (single line)
+ Nonetheless evidence of expanding company in line with wider industry

*Silk Throwster* could be anything from 1 (self employed) to 700+ employees…
 + Davenport had 10 despite troubles (may have misheard)
+ Average 135

**Losses of fire**
+ She didn’t own factory, only leased
+ Derby Mercury noted *substantial* loss but unclear precise

**Estimating Value / Work **
+ Comparative insurance claims indicate Davenport needed considerable capital investment to run her business
+ Comparison of house nearby gives an indication of the setup of the silk throwster building
+ Davenport owned several premises; one offered to sale in Mercury—listed machinery helps us understand how the business was run
+ Building still exists in 1970 -- Davenport had top three levels (probably only silk thread produced)
+ Similar mill in Chesterfield (almost identical) -- 3000lbs of silk produced a year
+ Using machinery for Full Street / Green Lane…likely 98 workers—this is proportional to known quantities of workers at Sheffield Mill

**A substantial business which collapsed in 1830s**
+ Reason unclear, but may have been undercapitalised
+ Similar to many other male throwsters
+ Bank account evidence found: prolonged economic distress may have been the reason (huge drop 1818-1819 and then again significant drop 1826-1831.
  + High balance and drop may have been insurance and repurchase of goods

Conclusion: Georgian business were not MORE vunerable because they were run by women.  No evidence she went bankrupt.  
+ Might have just been reassessing which business she wanted to be involved in considering economic climate.
+ Reappears in 1861 as a shareholder in railways
+ Her silence compared to her husband: Many, many notices for dissolution of partnerships 1802-1815
## The Value of Books and the Values of Creativity 
*Chair: Marcia Bessa Marques Louey Seminar Room*

### Leah Orr, Prices of English Books at Auction ca. 1680 ###
+ Large availability of second hand books at far lower prices than new one of the same title
+ Records indicate a large number of discounted books of relatively new books, even ‘cheaper’ texts
+ Only 8% sold at auction at higher than listed price, 6% at price and the rest at less, sometimes far less
+ Discussion of the selling of unbound books (which may have been personalised for previous owners)
+ 22 of the 32 that sold at higher prices were very cheap to begin with (with relatively small increases)
+ There was an average 44% discount, opening up the market to a wider range of readers
+ Quality and ‘fanciness’ does not always translate into expected price difference in the ‘same’ text.  Condition isn’t, however, noted.
+ Price is consumer driven rather than ‘intrinsic’ and good be more or less than ‘retail’ price at different auctions. 
  + Availability, Demand, Binding  Nothing to do with text or author
+ Relatively new books in second-hand auctions as well as possibly in ‘stores’ making it a wide range of prices for a contemporary literature market
