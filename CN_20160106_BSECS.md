'Drawing Blanks: The Poor and the Growth and Collapse of the Lotteries' by James Raven (Cambridge)

**Part of a book project with @OUPAcademic Lottery Lives**

Begins with an anecdote of an attack on two (female) witnesses against men accused of violating gambling laws, leaving constables gravely injured.

+ Tensions over social normality of gambling and gambling debts amongst aristocracy and such laws
  + Charles James Fox had lost over 100k before age 25, left debt of 10k at death
  
+ Real moral panic in wake of French Revolution or "The Josephine Argument": Banning private gambling and directing it to state lottery, which Joseph iI controlled?
  + "What can comparative state attitudes to gambling (prohibition vs permissiveness) tell us about fiscal/social views?" HT @SMCoulombeau 
  + Insurance at Lloyd's became like 'gambling at Whites'

### British Lotteries Overview ###

**Lotteries**

+ Original raffles, largely financial failures
+ After 1690s became more financially secure
+ Over 18th century, state lotteries developed in various European countries
+ Local and private lotteries, raffles continued, especially in Low Countries
+ English and Irish lotteries seen as akin to government bonds--guaranteed return (via annuity) but spreading over decades led to poor returns

**19th Century**

+ Contractors who ran lottery became more desperate as purchases thinned
+ Some prizes were bundles of future tickets

**State Finance**

+ More people 'contributed' via lottery than other funds (1762)
+ Funded major war efforts in 18th century
+ Funded Westminster Bridge
+ Helped established (what became) British Museum
 
**European Lotteries**

+ Discussion of French and Spanish state lotteries
+ Although not as prominent as in Britain / France, Spanish lotter after 1763 still very important and under recognised part of Enlightenment reforms
+ Irish lotteries to fund church refurbishments and hospitals

**Collapse of Lotteries**
A slight modification from previous writings…

+ Moral Crusade against lottery secondary to questions over its efficiency for raising state funds
+ Wilberforce (apocryphal?): What should we abolish next?

**But**

“We shouldn’t underestimate moral concern about the poor”

+ Discussion against lottery a continuation of 18th century concerns over gambling in Britain
+ Banning of French Lottery and Regulations in Tuscany but there are essential differences between systems
  + Motivation for the suppression of private lotteries differed
  + On the continent, mostly an effort to stop *foreign* lotteries, rather than domestic private ones
  + Britain also had concerns about foreign lotteries, there were few sustained efforts or campaigns against them

** British Case**

+ Growth of 'shares' brought lottery into the discretionary spending of about 1/4 of population (Britain)
+ Development of secondary gambling (and legislative crackdown thereof from 1739 Gaming Act)
+ Social gap evident considering the rampant betting amongst gentry and aristocracy as time of attack (opening anecdote)
+ 1790s discussion of the 'little go' private lottery draws--and how they were fixed according to the *Times*

**Conclusion**

+ Discusses social background of attackers (including boxers)
  + Indication of professional underworld (gang warfare between gambling providers and informants)
+ Greater prosecutions of working-class gambling but some compassions for “Poor deluded” who had been “plundered”

## Cultures of Trade and Commerce ##  
Chair: N. G. Howe, Ho Tim Seminar Room

### Rachael Morton, Changing Perceptions of Quality in the English Metalware Trade, c.1674-1774 ###

+ Speaks of the growth of the metalware trade, particularly of consumer goods such as toys
+ Movement from "Bromich ware", low-quality items at the start of the century, to "Birmingham Ware", quality at the end of the century
+ Papers to explore expansion of trade in Birmingham and Sheffield and the tensions between 'quality' providers in London  
 + **Argues that quality was not just its tangible qualities, but all the reputations attached to it**
  + Regulation as well as the consensus of the population in determining quality
  + Because of innovation, lower price could still be higher quality

*Development of Hallmarks*

+ Because silver could be melted down into bullion / specie, authenticating purity very important
+ Hallmark; Location of assay office, year, composition, producer 
+ Originally in London, Chester, Exeter, Newcastle and York but this meant costs / chance of intellectual piracy for Sheffield and Birmingham producers
+ Birmingham out of regulatory framework and so hard greater freedom
  + London opposed opening of Birmingham office out of fears of competition
+ Inclusion of imitative marks (that weren’t actually regulated)
  + Forgeries about ‘London’ or later ‘Birmingham’ made indicate shifts in idea of quality reputation
+ Registration of Marks but the guilds (on item, in register and touch plates)
  + Black list circulated to producers and sometimes newspapers

*Reporting Poor Quality*

+ Compensation to consumers who sued for poor metalware
+ Books on how to spot poor quality
+ Trade cards displayed marks, they were understood by general public


### Gönül Bakay, The Levant Company: The Expansion and Contraction of British-Ottoman Commercial Relations in the Long Eighteenth Century ###

+ Opens with the early years of Anglo-Ottoman trade relations in 16th century, defying French objections
+ Initial monopoly to Governor and Company of the Merchants of the Levant 
  + By 1595 many of the agents traded on their own account 
  + Initially agents were single men who worked for 3 years then returned home and traded from then on in their own right
+ Merchant company also helped build up and maintain political relations

**Quotes a fantastically long address to the Sultana**

+ Families discouraged from going with factors, as they were not supported by company; none seem to have lived in poverty
+ In 17th century, company given trading rights without time limitation—reached height in 1670s

**Reasons of the Demise of the Company (1780s—1820s)**

+ Contemporaries accused them of greed and monopolistic tendencies
  + End of private shipping to general shipping in company by-laws in 1780
+ Rise of French Trade: greater number of ships, better market research
+ Relations with Persia: Division by Russia and Ottoman affecting silk trade

### Peter Collinge, The Silken Phoenix, Sarah Davenport (1779-c.1865), Enterprise and the Derby Silk Industry ###

Sets the stage: Davenport pregnant and widowed with no specific instruction to take over husband’s business; in 1817 a fire destroyed silk factory. Insurance only covered part of the machinery 

+ Cannot regain Davenport through traditional corporate history means – no business records, journal, or correspondence.  
+ Fragmentary evidence in vital records, newspaper, will (single line)
+ Nonetheless evidence of expanding company in line with wider industry

*Silk Throwster* could be anything from 1 (self employed) to 700+ employees…
 + Davenport had 10 despite troubles (may have misheard)
+ Average 135

**Losses of fire**
+ She didn’t own factory, only leased
+ Derby Mercury noted *substantial* loss but unclear precise

**Estimating Value / Work **
+ Comparative insurance claims indicate Davenport needed considerable capital investment to run her business
+ Comparison of house nearby gives an indication of the setup of the silk throwster building
+ Davenport owned several premises; one offered to sale in Mercury—listed machinery helps us understand how the business was run
+ Building still exists in 1970 -- Davenport had top three levels (probably only silk thread produced)
+ Similar mill in Chesterfield (almost identical) -- 3000lbs of silk produced a year
+ Using machinery for Full Street / Green Lane…likely 98 workers—this is proportional to known quantities of workers at Sheffield Mill

**A substantial business which collapsed in 1830s**
+ Reason unclear, but may have been undercapitalised
+ Similar to many other male throwsters
+ Bank account evidence found: prolonged economic distress may have been the reason (huge drop 1818-1819 and then again significant drop 1826-1831.
  + High balance and drop may have been insurance and repurchase of goods

Conclusion: Georgian business were not MORE vunerable because they were run by women.  No evidence she went bankrupt.  
+ Might have just been reassessing which business she wanted to be involved in considering economic climate.
+ Reappears in 1861 as a shareholder in railways
+ Her silence compared to her husband: Many, many notices for dissolution of partnerships 1802-1815

## The Value of Books and the Values of Creativity 
*Chair: Marcia Bessa Marques Louey Seminar Room*

### Leah Orr, Prices of English Books at Auction ca. 1680 ###
+ Large availability of second hand books at far lower prices than new one of the same title
+ Records indicate a large number of discounted books of relatively new books, even ‘cheaper’ texts
+ Only 8% sold at auction at higher than listed price, 6% at price and the rest at less, sometimes far less
+ Discussion of the selling of unbound books (which may have been personalised for previous owners)
+ 22 of the 32 that sold at higher prices were very cheap to begin with (with relatively small increases)
+ There was an average 44% discount, opening up the market to a wider range of readers
+ Quality and ‘fanciness’ does not always translate into expected price difference in the ‘same’ text.  Condition isn’t, however, noted.
+ Price is consumer driven rather than ‘intrinsic’ and good be more or less than ‘retail’ price at different auctions. 
  + Availability, Demand, Binding  Nothing to do with text or author
+ Relatively new books in second-hand auctions as well as possibly in ‘stores’ making it a wide range of prices for a contemporary literature market

### Ann van Allen-Russell, Imaginative Territory: J. C. Bach, C. F. Abel and the Rise of Intellectual Property ###

+ Discussion of (3) lawsuits by Back and Abel against music publishers James Longman and Charles Lukey
  1. Were they trying to transform English law to include music labour
  2. Did they consider their music their ‘property’ 

*Relevant Timeline:*

•	1710 – SoA: 14 years with 14 year extension
•	1735/7 – Failed Attempts to extend laws
•	1743 – Argued for common law protect of texts (Battle of the Booksellers -> 1774)
•	Miller v. Taylor (1768/9) – ruled in favour of common law property rights for author
•	Donaldson v Becket (1774) – ruled SoA negated common law protections

+ Although both sides agreed manual and intellectual labour were different, they disagreed whether mental labour should be protected
+ Discussions of occupation vs possession
  + Harmed if author prevented from procuring financial benefit from their own work
  + Diverting profits as harmful as any other trespass

** Bach and Abel Suits **
+ Unauthorised publications arrangements and distributions of several compositions violated royal privileges (just barely!) of 14 years exclusivity 
+ Filed between Miller v Taylor and Donaldson v Beckett so could claim common law as well as privilege 
  + Normal practice to obtain cease and desist + profits made
+ Move from Chancery Court into petition (with booksellers) to Parliament 
  + House of Commons did not include music petition as part of law (Booksellers Relief Bill) going forward
  + Returned to Chancery Court
  + Ruled in favour of JCV and referred to King's Bench, led to inclusion of music in Statue of Anne

## Round Table: What’s the Point of the Academic Book? ##
Chair: Matthew Grenby, MGA Lecture Room  
Speakers: Tim Hitchcock, Mari Shullaw and Rebecca Lyons

### Rebecca Lyons: Opening Remarks ###
Researcher for Academic Book of the Future Project 
+ What do we mean by ‘academic book’? In an open discussion among British lIbrary staff, there was no real consensus
+ They are continuing evolving—there must be a point if this is the case
+ Beyond ‘free resources’ such as Wikipedia, there is the value added of academic publishers – a stamp of quality on the content (and making them quite pretty)
+ But you can have that in a journal article? Why a Book?
  + A structure that makes them ‘eminently useable’ 
  + Memory of the geography of each individual book (mnemonic function)
  + Personal choice of marginalia (and looking back at scribblings from undergraduate days)
+ The long form argument is an important part of Literature and History discipline
+ An important availability of choice as to the format that works best for the author’s need
+ Too expensive?
  + Yes (if no one buys them, are we talking to no one)
  + No, as research distribution has prompted new innovations and challenges (digital books, print on demand)
+ Lots of new possibilities are opening up, so it’s not the end!

### Mari Shullaw: Opening Remarks ###
Boyer and Boydell (Independent Academic Publisher of books, not journals, not science)
+ Academic Books as a space for academics to meet
+ 85% of publishing is still hard-copy
+ Haven’t yet (been asked to) published Open Access
+ Many Challenges
  + Increased costs
  + Reduced Runs
  + Library Budgets diminished (around the world)
+ Lowering price doesn’t necessarily increase sales as much as they had hoped

**Formats**
+ The Browser of the book values the whole book, the pleasure of the journey, the meanders and digressions 
  + At the moment, this is more difficult in electronic formats because of missing marginalia and two-handed reading (flipping back and forth) 
  + There isn’t enough time in the day to do this all the time, sometimes searching for the piece we need is the right course
+ Attempts to make a digital object (referring to Tim) haven’t been easy, however great the potential
+ There is no reason print and digital won’t happily co-exist for some time to come

+ The writing of the book is part of the academic digestion system
+ Do we think of the Academic Book as where the research ends? 
+ OA Journals and Digital Formats allow for flexibility on point-of-project and length

+ A good editor will help shape the work before going out to review and mediating the reviews when they come back in, as well as a degree of detachment from your own institutional politics
+ Publishers rely on authors – if you really, really want to go in a certain direction, we will
