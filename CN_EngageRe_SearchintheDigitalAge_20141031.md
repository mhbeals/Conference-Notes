### Information Obesity: Finding the best diet for you ###
Martin Wolf, *University of Liverpool*: <http://www.liv.ac.uk/library/help/staff.html>

#### Problems ####

What are the problems associated with **information obesity**?
+ Empty Calories (Wrong type of information being consumed)
+ Poor Digestion (Failure to turn information into knowledge)

What causes information obesity?
+ Time pressures (convenience always wins over quality, if we are honest)
+ Environmental issues (filter bubble)
+ Prior experience (we do what we have done previously so long as it has **worked**)

How to stop it?
+ Be more active users of information 
  + Be systematic in literature review, especially computer searching
+ Filter more effectively
  + But beware of creating own filter bubble
+ Use networks
  + Reading groups to expand and direct reading choices
  + Social bookmaking

#### Specialist Resources ####

#### Determining authority and usefulness ####

What information do you use?
+ Biographical evidence
+ Institutional evidence (publisher, printer, editor, etc)
+ Branding of presentation
+ Identity of the funders
+ Build upon "personal recommendations"
+ Contextual information
  + Co-location
  + Relation to other sources (intertexuality)
  + Type of resource
  
Is it all just trial and error?

#### What does data management mean for you? ####

+ Know your funders' requirements
  + AHRC 'technical summary'
  
+ How will you provide access in 3 years? 10 years? 
  + To yourself as well as others
  
+ Could others benefit from your data in ways you hadn't imagined?
  + Avoid 'data snafus' of not having documentation 
    + 'What does that variable mean? Oh, the post grad who has left knew that.
  + You can have good Data Managment without being 'OPEN', *but not the reverse*


+ * You should have a data management plan BEFORE you start any new project *
